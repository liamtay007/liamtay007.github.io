Finch was cycling alongside the car, when he got a phone call, so he cycled to the side. His phone showed that it was an unknown number, however he knew from research into Bruce Juice that it was his personal number.  </br>
“What do you want?” asked Finch through gritted teeth.</br>
“Nothin’ I just called.”</br>
“ I’ve heard that voice before….?”</br>
“ It’s Jack you dolt.”</br>
“ Ohhhh.”</br>
“ I’ve got his phone and I think I know where Bruce is going.”</br>
“ Where?” gasped Finch.</br>
“ Mars!”</br>
Finch hung up.    </br>
</p>
<p>

After a long cycle back, Finch reached the gun-runners house where ,to his annoyance,he got soaked by Jack who was holding a hose.</br>
“What the…” spluttered a bewildered Finch as he fell of his bicycle.</br>
“Sorry, I wanted to show you the hose.” Jack said innocently.</br>
“Why?” Finch asked as he scrambled up</br>
“ It was left on.” Jack said suddenly becoming serious to clear his friend’s name.</br>
“ What?… why?” Finch wondered aloud.</br>
“ To destroy something.” answered Jack.</br>
He led Finch the dining area of Juice’s house where a sheet of soggy paper was lying.</br>

The rest was illegible but the two friends immediately began doing what they could to find out where that was. Finch searched it on google on his phone whereas Jack tried to build a diagram of the car Juice was in from memory to check if Juice had left his car behind.</br>

</p>
<p>
“ Praia da Adraga  is in Portugal, it’s a beach.” exclaimed Finch</br>

“ Great work,” murmured Jack who span around and grabbed Finch’s phone.</br>
“Hey!” cried Finch.</br>
Jack,ignoring Finch, called the Italian emergency number saying in an Italian accent,
“Hello I want to report a missing car.”</br>
The operator said,
“ I do’t spaek englash vey wel can yo spaek Italiom?”</br>
“ No unfortunately.”</br>
“ O,c. </br>”
“ The number plate is Eg6 879”</br?
“ O,c.”</br?
“ Will you do it?”</br?
“Yuas.”</br?
“…..”</br?
“Dome.”</br?
“ OK.”</br?
“ Godbuvedy.”</br?
And with that Jack hung up. He turned to Finch and tossing back his phone he asked,
“ So…..you want to go to Portugal?” </br?
