Finch waited patiently for his companion to return to his seat next to him in the plane. </br>
“Are you scared of heights?”asked Finch when Jack returned.Jack, in return, shot him a loathing look. </br>
“Yeah right,” he scoffed,”you thinking I’m scared of heights, it’s vice versa.” </br>
“Too true, too true,” said Finch. </br>

</p>
<p>

The plane touched down at 11:30 in the morning, the sun already high in the sky.  </br>
“It looks like we were on the same plane as the shooter.” said Finch, pointing at the twenty-nine-year-old-woman standing by the luggage collection point. “Prepare for contact.” </br>
“In English please.” sighed Jack impatiently. </br>
“Get ready to smash her.” </br>
“SERIOUSLY!!!” </br>
“SHUT UP!!! SHE MIGHT RECOGNISE US!!!” yelled Finch. “DON’T DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF!!!” </br>
“Er… security is on it’s way.” </br>
“Oh.” </br>
“Does this count as drawing attention to your self?” </br>
“Erm…”   </br>
“Shall we leg it?” </br>
“Yeah let’s leg it.”  </br>

</p>

<p>
"She drives a Mercedes?”asked Jack </br>
“Nah, she’s got a driver for that.” They were hiding outside another mansion populated by the island’s most wanted assassins. “The………driver?”   </br>
“Yeah, she’s got her own driver.” </br>
“NEE NAW NEE NAW RICHIE ALERT RICHIE ALERT!!!!!” </br>
“Shut up.” </br>
“Why???”Jack whined.  </br>
“In the car at eight o’clock…Hey what are you doing?” </br>
“Looking at your watch- it must be wrong ‘cause I’m pretty sure it’s nine o’clock.”        </br>
Finch sighed and looked up with a wishful expression until, suddenly, a look of panic over took. </br>
“What’s the matter, buddy?”asked Jack. </br>
“They’re going to the airport,” yelled Finch.   </br>
“So?” </br>
“They’re escaping the country!” </br>
“Oh god…” </br>
“Shut up ,I’ll go after them on the bike, you break in and look for clues of why they’re leaving the country and any clues of where they’re going next.” </br>
“Aye….” </br>
Finch ran off and grabbed their newly bought bike and sped after them in hot pursuit to clear his name. </br>
Jack however charged through a extremely large cat flap and when he got up he saw a newspaper on a page that read:
