Finch woke up sprawled on his bed. Yawning, he thought about his day ahead at Zizzi’s. Well it’s better than being on the run or in prison he thought; you see Finch hadn’t always been a Zizzi chef; he’d been a poisoner trying new poisons on people, but somehow nobody died. Finch had finished his breakfast and was walking to Zizzi when his best friend Jack, a delivery boy, rode past on his motorbike. He halted the engine leapt off and said, in his realistic Mexican accent,                                                                          ‘Finchy-winchy why are you walking ten miles? You can hitch a ride with me if you like .”         </br>
”Cut the accent Jack, but ok.”</br>
“Jump on, if you can!,” retorted Jack, this time in an Italian accent.”Your to weird for this…..”  </br>
“English please,” Finch cut him off.  </br>
“Meanie.”  Jack revved the engine and shot of in the direction of Top Pizzi.</br>
</p>

<p>
When they had got there Finch tumbled into the Zizzi’s, while Jack circled round to Top Pizzi.“Good morning Finch,” said the head chef. </br>
“Good morning,” replied Finch.He was handed a pizza base.</br>
“Start cooking.” He did so.Suddenly out the corner of his eye,he saw poison on a man’s pepperoni!</br>
“Stop! Your eating poison,” he screamed. </br>
“Huh?”that was the man’s last word before the deadly poison killed him. All the chefs screamed apart from the head chef and Finch </br>
“What the heck happened here?” asked the head chef, “and where the heck is Finch?” </br>
Outside, Finch walked briskly to Top Pizzi and found Jack .“Jack, somebody’s died . . . So it looks like we’ve got a case.”  
</p>

<p>
Back at Finch’s home, the two friends were discussing the situation.     </br>
“We’re not detectives, or police officers or even lawyers,” commented Jack.</br>
“There’s a difference between police officers and detectives?” inquired Finch, raising an eye-brow</br>
“Oh yes,”</br>
”Really because I thought detectives were a type of POLICE OFFICER.”</br>
”Only if they work for the police. . .Ok this is stupid; we’re bickering when somebody just DIED! So… somebody plants the poison to kill a small time plumber?”  </br>
“He was part of the anti-mafia group called AAM Action Against the Mafia!”</br>
“Huh?” said Jack, who had no idea what on earth Finch was talking about.</br>
“It’s a criminal organisation, and our ‘small time plumber’ was looking into the Sicilian Mafia, but the police don’t know that; AAM is top secret.”</br>
“So you’re their prime suspect.” said Jack, who had only just realised what the problem was, then said, thoughtfully, “So why don’t you just tell them?”</br>
“They wouldn’t believe me; I have no proof.”</br>
“So who’s our prime suspect?” asked Jack.</br>
“Bruce Juice, a ringleader for the Mafia’s gun trafficking operation.”</br>
“WHA’?!!!!!” responded Jack.</br>
“Google it.”</br>
“Whatever.” </br>
“Bruce the Juice man..”</br>
“BAD JOKE ALERT!”</br>
“Shut up. Now where was I? Ah yes, Bruce has an ex-girlfriend (I did some research), who now lives in America, Washington DC.”                                               
</p>
<p>
“So basically hello America.” 
</p>

<p>
“God that flight was terrible” exclaimed Finch.</br>
“Hear hear!” was his reply.</br>
“Taxi!” bellowed Finch. A taxi pulled up, lowering its window.</p>

 					<a href="#" class="image"><img src="/images/finch/taxi.png" alt="marmoset" style="max-width:30%" /></a>

<p>
“They call it a cab in America” pointed out Jack, still trying to annoy Finch despite being severely jet lagged.</br>
“We call it cab in America” said the cab driver making Jack give Finch a knowing look that said I told you so, “Where would you like to go?” continued the driver, his strong American accent shining through, making his words barely perceptible as English.</br>
“Follow that Jag’!” replied Finch, who had seen their target get into chauffeur-driven car. They leaped into the car as it sped after the Jaguar.</br>
”You know I’ve waited a long time to get that sort of action!” said their driver, who then ruined his line by babbling on about how he only became a cab driver because they did cool car chases in the movies.</br>
</p>

<p>
Outside the taxi Finch walked up to an ornate door and knocked.</br>
“ Wow,” observed Jack looking around him at the grand mansion they had arrived at. The door was opened by a maid, who said, in a very posh accent</br>
“One presumes that ye are here for thy master.”</br>
“What the hell?!?” yelled Jack, who was sick of not understanding people.</br>
“Come in.” translated the maid, allowing her true American accent to come through.</br>
“We’d be honoured to,” smiled Finch keeping his eye on Jack for any more weird behaviour.</br>
 “By the way, one should presume that thee,” Jack gestured towards Finch,”is an idiot.” said Jack in a posh accent. Finch sighed. 
</p>


<p>
“ How nice it is to meet you.” said rich Sasha Eh, the ex-girlfriend of Bruce Juice. They were sitting around a million-dollar table decorated with silver cutlery and crystal cups</br>
”Thank you, but we’ve come to ask some questions,”said Finch.</br>
“Well ask away,”</br>
“Do you have anything to do with Bruce Juice and his gun trafficking operation?”a sudden surprised look came across  Sasha’s face; “You’re bringing him down?”</br>
“Yes.” replied Finch</br>
The door bell rang “Er… sorry I’ve going to get that.” Sasha left the room.</br>
“She’s gone you know.” said Finch</br>
“Of course I know; she just walked out of the room!” retorted Jack, “So do you suspect her?”</br>
“I guess-”</br>
 “She’s being suspicious,” interrupted Jack</br>
“Stop interrupting. And why is she being suspicious ?”      </br>
“Well, don’t butlers and maids open doors?”</br>
</p>


<p>

BANG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
</p>


<p>
Finch and Jack both toppled off there chairs</br>
“What was that?”gasped Finch </br>
“Sasha!!!!!!!!!”cried Jack</br>
“Yeah; what about her?”</br>
“She’s dead!!!” </br>
“Oh.” said Finch. He spun around to find a 4mm semi-automatic pistol pointed at his head.</br>
“We don’t want any trouble,were here for cheese,” Finch seemed to be having one of those moments when he just said anything that came to mind. Which wasn’t very much and was usually complete nonsense</br>
“What the hell?? What do you know about Bruce Juice?”asked the gun-wielding maid.</p>

 					<a href="#" class="image"><img src="/images/finch/kawaiicheese.png" alt="marmoset" style="max-width:30%" /></a>
<p>
“We don’t know anything . . .we’re just . . .cheese men?”said Jack, not sounding very convincing.</br>
 BANG!!!!!!!!!!! the maid sent a bullet at ceiling to keep them under control. And to warn them that she would not hesitate to put an end to their existence. Permanently.</br>
“SHUT UP!!!! You’re just a kid!!! What the HECK are you doing here?????” Jack replied by flinging the table up, shooting up cutlery, cups and half-eaten cakes into the air…and then down onto the maid’s head.</br>
”RUN!!!!!” shouted Jack. With a lot of mad scrambling Jack and Finch managed to escape to several kitchen cupboards.They watched in terror as the shooter exited the building (via the back door.)                      </br>
“Sicily,”said Jack.</br>
“Huh?”</br>
“The shooter was Italian,”</br>
“So? Oh let me guess…”</br>
“Yep; hello Sicily,” said Jack, “Oh, and by the way….”</br>
“Yes,”</br>
“Where the hell did you get?”mimicking Finch’s voice, “ ‘We don’t want any trouble we’re here for cheese?’ ” </br>
“That big block of cheddar.”       </br>
“You’re mad!!!”</br>
